# A WordPress Theme
The theme I'm using for derekmoran.dev


This is my first wordpress theme. It almost certainly does not follow all wordpress best practices. There are some things hard coded. If you're looking for a professional theme this probably isn't for you. But if you like the looks of my site and are familiar with HTML/CSS/PHP, then by all means feel free to copy this and turn it into your own.
